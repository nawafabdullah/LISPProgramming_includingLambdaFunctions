This README provides the specifications for the lab 4 take home exercise

Lab requirements:
-----------------

The objective for this week's lab is to implement the a circle "object"
using let over lambda (with labels), and an overlaps function that
operates on two circles.

In this case, your lab4a.cl file should contain just the definition of
the circle "constructor", and the  definition of the overlaps function.
Your lab4a.cl can be loaded and run using the lab4b.cl script provided.


The circle "constructor"
------------------------
Following the let over lambda (labels) structure we have discussed in
lectures and the lab session, complete the circle definition, providing
support for the following:

   - a default circle has x,y values of 0,0 and radius of 1, e.g. if defined using
       (defvar c (circle))

   - custom values can be set for a circle's x,y,radius (in that order) at creation, e.g.
       (defvar c (circle 1 2 3))
     error handling: all values must be numeric, and radius must be greater than 0,
       the default values are used in place of any invalid values passed

   - getx, gety, getr commands are supported to look up the current value
       of x, y, and radius for a circle, e.g.
       (setf result (funcall c 'getx))

   - setx, sety, setr commands are supported to change the current value
       of x, y, and radius for a circle, e.g.
       (funcall c 'setx 10)
     error handling: does not change the value of x/y/r if passed an invalid value

   - dispatcher: generates an error message if an invalid command is passed, e.g.
        (funcall c 'foo 10)

The overlap function
--------------------
This function expects two circles as parameters, and returns true if they
touch or overlap, false otherwise.  The algorithm to be used is as follows:
   if (x1 + r1 + r2) < x2 return false
   if (x2 + r1 + r2) < x1 return false
   if (y1 + r1 + r2) < y2 return false
   if (y2 + r1 + r2) < y1 return false
   compute the distance between the two centres:
      dist = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
   if dist > (r1 + r2) return false
   return true

The function returns false if passed invalid parameters.
