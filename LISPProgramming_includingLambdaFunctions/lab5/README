This README provides the specifications for the lab 5 exercise on macros.

Lab requirements:
-----------------

The objective for this week's lab is to improve the timer macro provided in lab5.cl.

Currently, the macro uses three hard-coded local variables to store the start time,
end time, and result of the command being run.  If those names are already in use
in the same scope as the macro call, then significant problems may arise.

Modify the macro so that it uses gensym to generate the names of the local variables
instead of hardcoding them.

Submitting
